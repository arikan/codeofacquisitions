Code of Acquisitions is a platform that exposes good and bad practices of art institutions and galleries based on published policies as well as cases of misconduct and abuse, where artists are not paid, not told the truth after sales, or did not get back their works.

Often a legal action is not possible to solve the conflict because of the precarious conditions of artists, and particularly because lack of establishing an individual juristic act overseas.

The Code of Acquisitions platform allows anyone to submit their cases anonymously or openly. Cases could range from gender and race discrimination to misconduct of payments. These submissions contribute to a database of conflicts, codes, and interactive visualizations that will increase awareness about the issues and hold organizations accountable through their reputation.
